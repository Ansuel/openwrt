Subject: [PATCH 17/33] net: dsa: qca8k: clear MASTER_EN after phy read/write

Clear MDIO_MASTER_EN bit from MDIO_MASTER_CTRL after read/write
operation. The MDIO_MASTER_EN bit is not reset after read/write
operation and the next operation can be wrongly interpreted by the
switch as a mdio operation. This cause a production of wrong/garbage
data from the switch and underfined bheavior. (random port drop,
unplugged port flagged with link up, wrong port speed)
Also on driver remove the MASTER_CTRL can be left set and cause the
malfunction of any next driver using the mdio device.
