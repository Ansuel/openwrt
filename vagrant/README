This folder contains configuration files for Vagrant development environment.
It's purpose is to easily create the environment that is used for building
of the Turris OS.

The environment created contains a fresh installation of Ubuntu 14.04 with
all the dependencies that are required for building of all the packages
that are currently present in the repository. The packages that are installed
during bootstrapping of the system are listed in vagrant_bootstrap.sh script
and can probably installed on any 64-bit Debian-based system.

To start the Vagrant instance, you need to do the following:

- install Vagrant (either from system's repository or from a package from
  the official Vagrant homepage http://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html)
- install LXC plugin for Vagrant: https://github.com/fgrehm/vagrant-lxc
  (you may also need to install its requirements, see README of vagrant-lxc)
- go to the directory containing cloned Turris' repository and create a symlink
  (or copy) the Vagrantfile configuration: ln -s vagrant/Vagrantfile

Then just simply start the Vagrant instance - Vagrant should download base file
for system and install all the dependencies. This can be achieved by executing
the following command (you'll be probably asked for your password because LXC
needs superuser privileges):

    vagrant up --provider-lxc

When the command finishes, you can connect to the fresh system using SSH:

    vagrant ssh

The mirrored content of Turris OS' repository can now be found in folder
/openwrt in the created guest system.
